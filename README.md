### 1 - Genetic Algorithm to solve TSP Rocket
- Solve a typical problem called travelling salesman using a genetic algorithm techniques.
- Numpy and PyGame libraries
- Find the best route to travelled by all the planets created by the user.

	OBS: In order to execute the project run the "train.py", not "environment.py". Also, after have placed planets click "Enter" ("Return" on Mac) for the code to start searching for the best route.
